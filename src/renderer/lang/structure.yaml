#
# Naming follows [BEM](http://getbem.com) (Block Element Modifier) naming conventions
# nested in logical groups of visually related elements.
#

#
# The given BEM structure `block-name__element-name--modifier-name` is here used as
# `element-type__element-name--modifier-name` e.g. `button__create-model--primvary: Yes, go ahead!`
# for a buttons which could sit close to a `button__cancel-model-creation--secondary: No Way!` button.
#
# The only exception is an (optional) shorthand for cases where `element-type` equals `element-name` e.g. `title__title`.
# Desv should consider wisely as this can lead to confusion in cases where you have a `label__label`
# surrounded by e.g. `error__label` and `placeholder__label`.
